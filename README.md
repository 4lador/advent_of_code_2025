# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

This is a project containing my solutions for Advent of Code 2025. I'm using this opportunity to leverage and improve my beginner-level skills in Rust programming.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: The main entry point of the program.
- `src/puzzles/`: Directory containing puzzle solutions organized by day (e.g., `day1.rs` for Day 1).
- `assets/`: Directory for puzzle input files (e.g., `assets/puzzle1/input.txt`).
- `Cargo.toml`: Defines the project and dependencies.

## Running the Solutions

Ensure you have Rust installed (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).

1. Clone or navigate to the project directory.
2. Run a specific day's solution (for now, only Day 1 is implemented):

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

   This will execute the solution for Day 1 and output the result.

## About Advent of Code and Rust

Advent of Code is an annual coding event consisting of daily programming puzzles, released from December 1st to 25th. These challenges range from algorithmic problems to creative solutions.

As a beginner in Rust, I'm tackling these puzzles to build familiarity with the language, its ownership model, error handling, and ecosystem. Each day's code may reflect incremental learning steps.
